    "Q1: Explanation of AI, ML, and DL\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI refers to computer systems that can simulate human intelligence—learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n",
    "Example: AI-powered chatbots like me help users by answering questions and assisting with tasks.\n",
    "- Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI, ML enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming.\n",
    "Example: Email spam filters that analyze incoming emails and classify them as spam or not spam.\n",
    "- Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to analyze complex patterns and large-scale data.\n",
    "Example: Facial recognition systems that identify people using deep neural networks.\n",
    "Q2: What is supervised learning? Examples\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data (i.e., input-output pairs).\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Image classification (e.g., detecting cats vs. dogs)\n",
    "- Fraud detection in banking\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis in social media comments\n",
    "- Predicting house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities\n",
    "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? Examples\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of ML where the model learns from data without explicit labels, discovering hidden patterns.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Clustering customer data for targeted marketing\n",
    "- Anomaly detection in network security\n",
    "- Topic modeling in text data analysis\n",
